Ja:
1 = lexical selection
2 = error in generation (different shape of wordform)
3 = error in choice of form (different wordform selected)
4 = word order changed
5 = punctuation
6 = word added
7 = word deleted

ein annan modell
4 = word order (word order changed, # word deleted or added) ab-ba, a-0, 0-a
8 =  Add
9 = /remove word 

4a = anna rekkjef ab-ba
4b = add 0-a
4c = delete a-0

kanskje sånn:
4a = word order changed / word deleted / word added -- traceable
4b = word order changed / word deleted / word added -- untraceable

Kanskje sånn:
4a = word order changed -- traceable
4b = word order changed -- untraceable
5a = word deleted / word added -- traceable
5b = word deleted / word added -- untraceable


a = add or remove word because { known from context | don't know why }
b = 
5 = punctuation mark added or deleted.
